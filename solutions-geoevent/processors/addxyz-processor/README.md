## Requirements

* See common [solutions-geoevent-java requirements](../../../README.md#requirements).
* The ArcGIS Runtime for Java SDK is required in order to run the standalone Maven Tests included with this project.

## Building 

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java instructions](../../../README.md#instructions) for general instructions on 
    * verifying your Maven installation
    * setting the location of GeoEvent Processor and GeoEvent Processor SDK repositories
    * and any other common required steps
* Open a command prompt and navigate to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/10.3.0/processors/addxyz-processor`
    * Enter `mvn install` at the prompt.

## Installation

* Install the AddXYZ Processor.
    * Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/processors/10.3.0/addxyz-processor/target` (this directory is created when you execute mvn install).
    * Copy the .jar file and paste it into the deploy folder in the GeoEvent Processor install directory ([GeoEvent Processor install location]\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy).


## Testing

### Validating the Installation
 
* See the [solutions-geoevent-java validation instructions](../../../README.md#validating-install).
    * Ensure the AddXYZ Processor exists.

### Testing with Simulated Test Data

#### Deploying the Test Configuration

If you have already deployed the test configuration you may move on to Testing the Component

In GeoEvent Extension Manager 

* Go to the Site >> Configuration Store Tab. 
* Click the 'Import Configuration' button. 
* Select 'Choose File'
* Browse to the ./solutions-geoevent-java/data/configurations/ directory 
* Select the SolutionsComponentTestConfig.xml 
* Click 'Open' in the dialog. 
* Click 'Next'. 
* When prompted choose 'Import Configuration'. 

The test service configuration will be deployed to your instance of GeoEvent.



#### Testing the Component

The Introduction to GeoEvent tutorial has a simple TCP-Console application that will be used for most of the tests. It can be found [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b6a35042effd44ceab3976941d36efcf).

You will use the AddXYZ-Test service from the Solutions Test Configuration to test the functionality of the AddXYZ processor.
* Open the AddXYZ-Test service in GEE Manager. 
* Click on the addxyz-tcp-txt-in Input and expand the 'Advanced' tab. Note that the input uses TCP port 5607.
* Open the ArcGIS GeoEvent Simulator (this is installed with GeoEvent Extension and can be found at the GeoEvent Extension install location).
* Make sure the Server points to the server on which GeoEvent Extension is deployed (default is local host).
* In the upper right, change the port to 5600 and  click the button with the red X to connect (Note: if you cannot connect the server is not listening on that port. This may be because the Input in GeoEvent extension has not been started).
* Make sure 'File' is selected in the combo box on the upper left.
* Click the 'Load File' button in the upper right.
* In the new dialog, click the file folder button in the upper right.
* Browse to the ./solutions-geoevent-java/data/simulation-files/ directory.
* Select addxyz.csv and click 'Open'
* Click the 'Load' button. In the Preview Edits window you will see 1 record.
* Browse to the directory of the TCP-Console application (if you downloaded it from the tutorial it will be at ./IntroductionToGeoEvent/utilities/tcp-server-app).
* Double click TCPServerApp.bat (the application will not start if no services are listening on port 5570 - if you have deployed the test configuration an output service has been configured to listen on this port. Check that the Output tcp-out-5570 has been deployed and started).
* In the GeoEvent Simulator click the 'Step' button.
* In the TCP-console you will see that the Received Event (Event Definition name) is AddXYZDef with a comma separated list of values.
