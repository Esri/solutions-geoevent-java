# CoT-Adapter

The CoT adapter provides an example of how to ingest Cursor on Target (CoT) messages as geoevents.

## Features

* Receives XML messages conforming to the CoT message format
* Converts message received using available GEP definitions

## Sections

* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Building](#building)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Licensing](#licensing)

## Requirements

* See common [solutions-geoevent-java requirements](../../../README.md#requirements)
* There are no additional requirements for this project

## Building 

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java instructions](../../../README.md#instructions) for general instructions on 
    * verifying your Maven installation
    * setting the location of the GEP Server and GEP SDK repositories
    * and any other common required steps
 * Open a command prompt and navigate to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/cot-adapter`
 * * Enter `mvn install` at the prompt

## Installation

* Install the adapter
    * Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/cot-adapter/target` (this directory is created when you execute mvn install).
    * Copy the jar file and paste it into the deploy directory on your GeoEvent server (<GEP install location>\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy)

## Testing

### Validating the Installation
 
* See the [solutions-geoevent-java validation instructions](../../../README.md#validating-install).

### Testing with Simulated Test Data

* In the following steps you will configure GEP to receive and process simulated CoT data
    * Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘GeoEvent Processor’ > 'GeoEvent Definitions'
    * Note that a GeoEvent Definition named CoT was created for you when you deployed the CoT Adapter'
![Image of create connector](doc/cot-geoeventdef.png)
    * Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘GeoEvent Processor’ > 'Connectors'
    * Note an inbound connector to receive CoT over http has been created when you deployed the CoT Adaptor. 
![Image of create connector](doc/cot-inbound-connector.png)
    * Note an  outbound connector to send CoT over a TCP channel that opens on demand has been created when you deployed the CoT Adaptor.

* Next use the GEP Manager and Service Designer to
    * Create an Input Service to receive CoT messages using the inbound connector created for you.
	* For the XSDPath_Path  property use the location of the CoTtypes.xml downloaded from github (<download location>/solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/cot-adapter/src/main/resources/CoTTypes/CoTtypes.xml)
	* For the CoTTypes_Path property use the location of the CoTtypes.xml downloaded from github (<download location>/solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/cot-adapter/src/main/resources/XSD-Add-on)
![Image of create connector](doc/cot-inbound-service.png)
    * Create an Output service to write output to json file (Note: this is not the outbound CoT connector created when you deployed)
![Image of create connector](doc/cot-outbound-service.png)
    * Create a simple service to direct the Input CoT over Http to an output json file
![Image of create connector](doc/cot-geoevent-service.png)
    * Use an html poster application such as Firefox Poster to send messages to the CoT service
    * Firefox Poster (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/poster/)
![Image of create connector](doc/cot-poster.png)
	* In the URL textbox put the receiver endpoint of your CoT inbound service in the form of: 'https://<host machine of geoevent server>:6143/geoevent/rest/receiver/<name of inbound service>'        
	* Browse to the simulation_files folder downloaded from github (<install location>/solutions-geoevent-java\data\simulation_files)
	* Open one of the CoT simulation files (Named CoT1.xml - CoT4.xml)
	* Copy and paste the contents into the content window of FireFox Poster
	* Click on the POST button in FireFox Poster
* Navigate to ‘Services’ > ‘Monitor’. The your CoT service should register 1 input and 1 output (note: your names/outputs may differ)

* Repeat with the other simulation files if desired
