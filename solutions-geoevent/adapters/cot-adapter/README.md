* [Building](#building)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Licensing](#licensing)

## Requirements

* See common [solutions-geoevent-java requirements](../../../README.md#requirements)
* There are no additional requirements for this project

## Building 

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java instructions](../../../README.md#instructions) for general instructions on 
    * verifying your Maven installation
    * setting the location of the GEP Server and GEP SDK repositories
    * and any other common required steps
 * Open a command prompt and navigate to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/cot-adapter`
 * * Enter `mvn install` at the prompt

## Installation

* Install the adapter
    * Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/cot-adapter/target` (this directory is created when you execute mvn install).
    * Copy the jar file and paste it into the deploy directory on your GeoEvent server (<GEP install location>\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy)

## Testing

### Validating the Installation
 
* See the [solutions-geoevent-java validation instructions](../../../README.md#validating-install).

### Testing with Simulated Test Data

* In the following steps you will configure GEP to receive and process simulated CAP data
* Open the GEP Manager web application
* Create a connector to receive file data updated to a folder
    * Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘GeoEvent Processor’ > 'Connectors'
    * Select Create Connector and configure as shown

* Next use the GEP Manager and Service Designer to
    * Create an Input to receive file data using the created connector 
    * Create an Output to observe received data
    * Create a simple service to direct the Input data to the Output

* An example of a simple file/folder input is shown below 
    * Choose the Input Connector "Watch a folder for new .json files"
    * Note: this will work for any file type, just select a wildcard or other compatible file filter
    * An example Input is shown below

* An example of a simple service is shown below 

![Image of service](doc/service.png)

* Navigate to ‘Services’ > ‘Monitor’ and observe that you have a configuration similar to the following (note: your names/outputs may differ)
